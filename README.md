# Python-R integration


--An experiment on integrating Python into R, and vice versa. 

I have written some simple code that runs a physics simulation, calculated via python and visualized via the R package ggplot2. This repo documents me playing with (losing sanity over) rpy2, the most popular python package for integrating R code into python, and reticulate, themost popular R package for integrating python code into R.
